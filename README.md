# Single_hand_keyborad
The keyboard built in this project is entitled the ‘S-Keyboard’. The project description was ‘Design of Keyboards and other interfaces for users with reduced capacity’. International computer keyboard is featured based on two-handed user and designed key functions are issues for one-handed user. For example, one of the computer keyboard function such as Ctrl- Alt- Del or Shift-Arrow, etc, often assume that the user can type with two hands. In order to solve that issue, this project aimed to create a new keyboard that allows for more efficient and effective use by one-handed users. In this project some assumptions of one-handed user will be used. Due to limited time and material, this project is made with the three main following assumptions: • One-handed user is able to use at least one-finger. • S-Keyboard layout is functioning only in S-keyboard’s program • Limited time is allowed to test on real user. This project is planned into three stages. Firstly, the background of existing one-handed is discussed to locate some issues of existing one-handed keyboard and facets that can be more improved. Secondly, based on the problem definition, implement a keyboard program that reduces the gap between current existing problems and technology. Finally, the program will be tested by different users to determine verified effectiveness and the report ends with some possible future development ideas.
